## What is Healthcare-Rollcall?

Healthcare-Rollcall is a web app designed to interact with the [Bmore-Responsive API](https://codeforbaltimore.github.io/Bmore-Responsive/). In the event of a disaster, Baltimore City and the Baltimore City Health Department (BCHD) needs to be able to verify the status of all healthcare providers in the city. Examples include:

- Widespread power blackout
- Epidemic or Pandemic response (COVID-19)
- Natural disaster
