## What is Healthcare-Rollcall?

Healthcare-Rollcall is a web app built on top of the [Bmore-Responsive API](https://codeforbaltimore.github.io/Bmore-Responsive/). In the event of a disaster, Baltimore City and the Baltimore City Health Department (BCHD) needs to be able to verify the status of all healthcare providers in the city.

## What does it do?

This system will provide methods for healthcare providers to check-in during disasters, and update their information during non-emergency periods. During an emergency this system will track providers responses to a questionnaire. This questionnaire can be specific to a single disaster, or can be more general. Examples:

- Widespread power blackout
- Epidemic or Pandemic response (COVID-19)
- Natural disaster

This system will make use of digital services and modern methodologies to automate parts of the check-in process to help the city prioritize its call list and response plan. Additionally, the system will validate contact information regularly during non-emergency times to ensure the city has the most up-to-date information for each provider.
