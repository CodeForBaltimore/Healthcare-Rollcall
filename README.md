# Healthcare Rollcall

In the event of a disaster, Baltimore City and the Baltimore City Health Department (BCHD) needs to be able to verify the status of all healthcare providers in the city.

## What is this?
This system will provide methods for healthcare providers to check-in during disasters, and update their information during non-emergency periods. During an emergency this system will track providers responses to a questionnaire.  This questionnaire can be specific to a single disaster, or can be more general.  Examples:

* Widespread power blackout
* Epidemic or Pandemic response (COVID-19)
* Natural disaster

This system will make use of digital services and modern methodologies to automate parts of the check-in process to help the city prioritize its call list and response plan. Additionally, the system will validate contact information regularly during non-emergency times to ensure the city has the most up-to-date information for each provider.

## Documentation

We've included a `docs` folder with a template [Tech Spec](/docs/Tech_Spec.md) and [Best Practices](/docs/Best_Practices.md) document, though using Github's Wiki capabilities is also a good idea. This will get you started with documenting your project.  Other documents and relevant information that has no other place can live in the `docs` folder.  Replace this paragraph with a brief breakdown of what you've included in your `docs` folder.

# Project setup

```shell
npm install
```

Add the following to a file named `.env` in your project directory:
```shell
VUE_APP_BASE_API_URL=<your API url>
```
Where <your API url> would be http://localhost:3000 if you're running the backend locally, by default PORT is 3000.

## Docker and docker-compose
To use the backend of this project in an easy way, a `docker-compose` file has been included for convenience. To run this you must add a few entries to your `.env` file.
```shell
DATABASE_URL=postgres://user:pass@example.com:5432/dbname
DATABASE_USER=<your username>
DATABASE_PASSWORD=<your password>
DATABASE_SCHEMA=<your schema>
```
The `DATABASE_URL` is not a very clear var name, and the string is broken down as `postgres://username:password@host:port/database_name`

An example of the `DATABASE_URL` would be `DATABASE_URL=postgres://user:pass@db:5432/dbname`

You would then run the docker-compose setup with `docker-compose up -d` to run the Db & API in detached mode and then `npm run serve` to run the frontend.

### Full .env example
Here is a full example of default values for our `.env` file. You should be able to copy/paste this directly and it will work locally, however we ***STRONGLY*** encourage you to use custom values.
```
VUE_APP_BASE_API_URL=http://localhost:3000
NODE_ENV=development
DATABASE_URL=postgres://postgres:postgres@db:5432/postgres
DATABASE_USER=postgres
DATABASE_PASSWORD=postgres
DATABASE_SCHEMA=public
JWT_KEY=abc123
BYPASS_LOGIN=true
```

## Compiles and hot-reloads for development

```shell
npm run serve
```

The application will be available at http://localhost:8080/

**Note:** Depending on the OS you are running `Docker` on your localhost may be mapped to a different IP address. The standard IP address `Docker` is mapped to on Windows is `192.168.99.100` so you would access the application at `192.168.99.100:8080`.  

## Compiles and minifies for production

```shell
npm run build
```

## Lints and fixes files

```shell
npm run lint
```

## Customize configuration

See [Configuration Reference](https://cli.vuejs.org/config/).

What does someone need to do to test their work? Have you included a specific testing framework or guideline (hint: you should)? Any information about testing should be added here.

# Sources and Links

We are also building a back-end API to feed and manage data for this project. To view that project, or to contribute to it, please visit the repo here: https://github.com/CodeForBaltimore/Bmore-Responsive

We will be including multi-repo build processes with the back-end that will reference this project.
